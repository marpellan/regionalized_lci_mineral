1,"Estimates for placer gold are not included in the monthly gold production data. Placer gold entities will be collected as part of the Annual Mineral Production Survey."
2,"Data for Quebec is collected by the Institut de la statistique du Québec (ISQ). Therefore, in some cases data is not available for Quebec, and Quebec’s estimates may not be directly comparable to data published for the rest of Canada. Statistics Canada is working with the ISQ to harmonize the survey content, so that respondents operating in Quebec will eventually answer the same monthly questionnaire being distributed to the rest of the provinces and territories."
3,"The sum may not add up to the total due to rounding."
6,"The value for refined metals was added in January 2021.
"
7,"The following refined commodities were added to the table in January 2021: bismuth, cadmium, germanium, iridium, palladium, platinum, rhodium and ruthenium.

"2317","2021-04-01","On April 1, 2021, data on refined copper, lead, nickel and zinc quantity produced, shipped and in closing inventories were corrected to align with the new unit of measurement in kilograms (formerly tonnes), for the reference months of January to October 2020.",
