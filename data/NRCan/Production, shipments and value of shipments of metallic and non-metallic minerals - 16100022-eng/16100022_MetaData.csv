1,"Preliminary estimates of mineral production for the most recent year are released together with the current reference year estimates to provide early indication of the state of the mining sector in Canada. Mineral producers reporting for the Annual Mineral Production Survey provide production for the current survey year as well as their forecasted production for the following year. Therefore, revisions to preliminary estimates can show greater fluctuations than revisions to historical data."
2,"The total aggregates, clay and refractory minerals category for Quebec includes data for reference year 2019, 2020 and 2021. Quebec’s 2022 data will be available at a later date."
3,"The sum may not add up to the total due to rounding."
7,"Starting on March 2024, dollar values for all reference periods are presented in thousands of dollars."
8,"As of March 2024, region-level data has been discontinued."
