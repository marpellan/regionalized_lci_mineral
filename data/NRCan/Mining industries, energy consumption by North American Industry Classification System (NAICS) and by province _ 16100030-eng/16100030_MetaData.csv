1,"The data are classified by industry based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 2017."
3,"The sum may not add up to the total due to rounding."
4,"The total aggregates, clay and refractory minerals category for Quebec includes data for reference year 2019, 2020 and 2021. Quebec’s 2022 data will be available at a later date. Quebec data includes the North American Industry Classification Standard (NAICS) codes 21231 (stone mining and quarrying) and 21232 (sand, gravel, clay, and ceramic and refractory minerals mining and quarrying)."
5,"The aggregates, clay and refractory mineral mining and quarrying (excluding non-metallic mineral mining) estimates at the Canada level do not include Quebec’s data for 2022, as these are not available with this release."
7,"Beginning with reference year 2019, the details for all energy types at the regional level are no longer available."
